      <p>
        Hello traveller, my name is Tobias. I am a 30 year old aspiring full-stack developer, podcast host, gamer and all round good dude.
        I started learning some coding basics in 2021 and found myself falling in love, so in 2022 I signed up for a coding bootcamp to further hone some skills!

        Film is my first love, I have studied Screen and Media at tafe which covered all sorts of filmmaking - writing scripts, cinematography, editing, practical effects and VFX.
        If I am not expanding my coding brain I will usually be watching a movie and talking about it on my podcast <a target='blank' href='https://directory.libsyn.com/shows/view/id/forevermovieboys'>Forever Movie Boys</a>
        or you can find me playing League of Legends - like a disgustingly sweaty, sweater
