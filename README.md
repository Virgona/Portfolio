## Motovation

I wanted to utilize the new React skills I learnt to build myself a professional portfolio that demonstrates my understandings of the framework. It also helps me to solidify these understandings

## Installation

No installation required for this - its just my portfolio you can browse, be impressed by and hire me from!

## Challenges

Design is my weakpoint. I really struggle with getting things positioned on the page and even coming up with an aesthetic that I am happy with. I think for the most part I overcame that on this project. Given more time I will be able to refine this

## Successes

It was a little tricky understanding how to get my resume to download from the app. After some study it was great when I was finally able to download my own resume from the deployed portfolio
